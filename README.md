# **Towers of Hanoi**

A [disk-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) game focused on moving all your disks from the first rod to the third rod.
Another simple Codecademy project, so may, *may* have errors.

## Features

- Everything you'd expect from a terminal game, such as:
  -  A interface that shows your current stacks and asks for input concerning your next move
  -  Congratulating text, which is *very* important.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up your game:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/PieAreSquared11/Towers-of-Hanoi.git
  ```
